# Prideinyourself.com

## The brief

To create a CRUD application with utilisation of supporting tools, methodologies and technologies that encapsulate all core modules covered during training.

## The concept

I have been sat on the domain prideinyourself.com for over a year, with a plan to do *something* with it, though that plan has changed and evolved as I have started to work on other projects.

As such, I plan to create a resource which houses stories about historical LGBTQ+ figures there so that teens are able to quickly and easily find examples of role models.
