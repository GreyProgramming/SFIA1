# Prideinyourself.com
V1.0

## The brief

To create a CRUD application with utilisation of supporting tools, methodologies and technologies that encapsulate all core modules covered during training.

### Required:
●	A Trello board (or equivalent Kanban board tech) with full expansion on user stories, use cases and tasks needed to complete the project. It could also provide a record of any issues or risks that you faced creating your project.
●	A relational database used to store data persistently for the project, this database needs to have at least 2 tables in it, to demonstrate your understanding, you are also required to model a relationship. 
●	Clear Documentation from a design phase describing the architecture you will use for you project as well as a detailed Risk Assessment.
●	A functional CRUD application created in Python, following best practices and design principles, that meets the requirements set on your Kanban Board 
●	Fully designed test suites for the application you are creating, as well as automated tests for validation of the application. You must provide high test coverage in your backend and provide consistent reports and evidence to support a TDD approach.
●	A functioning front-end website and integrated API’s, using Flask.
●	Code fully integrated into a Version Control System using the Feature-Branch model which will subsequently be built through a CI server and deployed to a cloud-based virtual machine.

## The concept

I have been sat on the domain prideinyourself.com for over a year, with a plan to do *something* with it, though that plan has changed and evolved as I have started to work on other projects.

As such, I plan to create a resource which houses stories about historical LGBTQ+ figures there so that teens are able to quickly and easily find examples of role models.

### Future possibilities
Lesson Plans - "Like for schools to use, if you make it user friendly teachers would use that kind of thing for gay pride month as it's on the curriculum" - C.L-C
Promotion via content creators by hosting links to their work - pivot with stonewall & unions.
